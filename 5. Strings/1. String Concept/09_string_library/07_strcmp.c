//		It's a function which basically takes the base address of both the strings.
//   From the base address, it checks character by character whether the characters of both are 
//   same or not with the help of corresponding ASCII value of the string

//	 It returns -  
//  	0 - when both are same strings
//  	1 - when the ASCII value of the correspoding 1st argument is greater than the 2nd ones ASCII
//  		of the correspoding positioned character
// 		-1 - when the ASCII value of the correspoding 1st argument is lesser than the 2nd ones ASCII
//  		of the correspoding positioned character
